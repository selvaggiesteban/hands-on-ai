## Template Usage Instructions

Each template has:

- **Mandatory fields** marked as `{{field_name}}`
- **Optional sections** marked as `[OPTIONAL]`
- **Data extracted from the analysis** that you must fill automatically
- **Fixed Markdown structure** that you MUST NOT modify

**Generation process**:

1. Identify which deliverables were selected in the initial checklist (Section 3.1)
2. Collect data from the code/project/documentation analysis
3. Fill each template with the extracted data
4. Validate that all mandatory fields are complete
5. Deliver each document as a separate .md file
