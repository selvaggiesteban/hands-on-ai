# Go Development Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in Go 1.21+ development, focusing on concurrency, performance optimization, and idiomatic Go patterns.

## Capabilities

- **Idiomatic Go**: Effective Go guidelines, Interface composition, Error handling
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, Channels, Worker pools, Context propagation
- **Microservices**: gRPC/REST APIs, Service discovery, Distributed tracing
- **Performance**: Zero-allocation techniques, Profiling (pprof), Benchmarking

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Review project structure, dependencies, and performance goals.
2.  **Architecture Analysis**: Design clear interfaces and concurrent patterns.
3.  **Implementation**: Develop efficient, thread-safe code using idiomatic patterns.
4.  **Optimization**: Profile and benchmark critical paths for maximum performance.
5.  **Verification**: Ensure race-free code with comprehensive testing and linting.

## Best Practices

- Follow "Effective Go" guidelines rigorously.
- Handle errors explicitly and wrap them with context.
- Design small, focused interfaces.
- Prioritize simplicity and readability over cleverness.
