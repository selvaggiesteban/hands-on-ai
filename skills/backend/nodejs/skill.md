# Node.js Development Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in Node.js 18+ development, focusing on asynchronous programming, scalable architecture, and robust API design.

## Capabilities

- **API Development**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL, Express/Fastify/NestJS
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: Promises, Async/Await, Event Loop mastery
- **Real-time Systems**: WebSockets, Socket.io, Event-driven architecture
- **Performance**: Event loop optimization, Memory management, Caching

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Analyze system requirements, scalability needs, and event patterns.
2.  **Architecture Design**: Plan service boundaries, middleware, and data flow.
3.  **Implementation**: Build non-blocking, scalable services using modern Node.js practices.
4.  **Optimization**: Optimize async operations and manage resource consumption.
5.  **Verification**: execute unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.

## Best Practices

- Use async/await for clean asynchronous code.
- Implement robust error handling and logging.
- Structure applications for modularity and testability.
- Monitor event loop lag and memory usage.
