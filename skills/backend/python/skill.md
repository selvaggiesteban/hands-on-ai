# Python Development Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in modern Python development, focusing on type safety, asynchronous programming, and Pythonic patterns.

## Capabilities

- **Modern Python**: Python 3.11+ features, Type hinting, AsyncIO
- **Web Frameworks**: FastAPI, Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Data Engineering**: Pandas, NumPy, Data processing pipelines
- **Quality Assurance**: Pytest, Mypy, Ruff, Black

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: specific requirements, environment setup, and typing standards.
2.  **Code Analysis**: Evaluate code style, type coverage, and potential bottlenecks.
3.  **Implementation**: Write idiomatic, type-safe Python code using async patterns where appropriate.
4.  **Refactoring**: Modernize legacy code to current standards and improve performance.
5.  **Verification**: Run rigorous tests and static analysis to ensure quality.

## Best Practices

- Enforce strict type checking with Mypy.
- Use Pythonic idioms (comprehensions, generators).
- Write comprehensive docstrings and documentation.
- Leverage async/await for I/O-bound operations.
