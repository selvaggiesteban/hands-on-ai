# GCP Cloud Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in Google Cloud Platform architecture, focusing on Kubernetes (GKE), BigQuery, and data analytics pipelines.

## Capabilities

- **Compute & Containers**: GKE, Cloud Run, Compute Engine, App Engine
- **Data & Analytics**: BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage
- **Networking**: VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud CDN
- **Security**: Cloud IAM, VPC Service Controls, Cloud Security Command Center

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Analyze workload requirements and data strategy.
2.  **Architecture Design**: Design cloud-native solutions leveraging GCP's strengths in data and containers.
3.  **Implementation**: Deploy resources using Terraform or Deployment Manager.
4.  **Data Engineering**: Build robust data pipelines and analytics infrastructure.
5.  **Verification**: Validate scalability, security, and performance benchmarks.

## Best Practices

- Leverage GKE for container orchestration excellence.
- Use BigQuery for serverless, highly scalable data warehousing.
- Implement zero-trust networking principles.
- Optimize costs using sustained use discounts and spot instances.
