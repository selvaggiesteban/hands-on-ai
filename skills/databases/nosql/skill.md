# NoSQL Database Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in NoSQL database design and optimization, covering MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, and DynamoDB.

## Capabilities

- **Document Stores**: MongoDB schema design, indexing, and aggregation pipelines.
- **Key-Value Stores**: Redis caching strategies, data structures, and persistence.
- **Wide-Column**: Cassandra/ScyllaDB modeling for high write throughput.
- **Performance**: Sharding strategies, replication tuning, and query optimization.

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Analyze data access patterns, volume, and consistency requirements.
2.  **Schema Design**: Design schemas optimized for specific NoSQL paradigms (denormalization, access patterns).
3.  **Implementation**: Configure clusters, implement sharding/replication, and write efficient queries.
4.  **Optimization**: Tune indexes, cache settings, and resource allocation.
5.  **Verification**: Benchmark performance under load and verify data consistency models.

## Best Practices

- Design schemas based on query patterns, not just data structure.
- Use appropriate sharding keys to ensure even data distribution.
- Implement proper consistency levels based on business needs (CAP theorem).
- Monitor read/write capacity units and latency metrics.
