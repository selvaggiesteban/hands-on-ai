# Angular Development Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in Angular development, focusing on modular architecture, reactive programming with RxJS, and performance optimization.

## Capabilities

- **Framework Mastery**: Angular 15+ features, Standalone components, Signals
- **Reactive Programming**: Advanced RxJS operators, State management (NgRx)
- **Architecture**: Module federation, Lazy loading, Smart/Dumb components
- **Performance**: Change detection strategies (OnPush), Bundle optimization

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Evaluate application scale, state complexity, and performance goals.
2.  **Architecture Planning**: Design module structure, routing, and state management strategy.
3.  **Implementation**: Build typed, reactive components and services.
4.  **Optimization**: Implement OnPush change detection and optimize bundle sizes.
5.  **Verification**: Execute unit tests (Jest/Jasmine) and E2E tests (Cypress).

## Best Practices

- Use strict TypeScript for type safety.
- Embrace reactive programming patterns with RxJS.
- Implement OnPush change detection for performance.
- Utilize lazy loading for feature modules.
