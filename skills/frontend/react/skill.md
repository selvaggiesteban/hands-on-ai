## Capabilities

- **Core React**: Hooks mastery, Context API, Suspense, Concurrent features
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query
- **Patterns**: Compound components, Custom hooks, Render props
- **Performance**: Memoization, Code splitting, Virtualization

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Review UI requirements, state needs, and component hierarchy.
2.  **Architecture Design**: Plan component structure and state flow.
3.  **Implementation**: Build reusable, composable components using modern hooks.
4.  **Optimization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize heavy computations.
5.  **Verification**: Ensure accessibility compliance and comprehensive test coverage.
