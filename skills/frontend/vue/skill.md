# Vue Development Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in Vue 3 development, focusing on the Composition API, reactivity system, and the Nuxt ecosystem.

## Capabilities

- **Core Vue**: Vue 3 Composition API, Reactivity (Ref/Reactive), Watchers
- **Ecosystem**: Nuxt 3, Pinia (State Management), Vue Router
- **Components**: Composables, Slots, Teleport, Suspense
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM optimization, Lazy loading, SSR/SSG

## Process

1.  **Context Assessment**: Determine project needs (SPA vs SSR) and complexity.
2.  **Architecture Design**: Design component hierarchy and composable logic.
3.  **Implementation**: Build reactive applications using script setup syntax.
4.  **Optimization**: Optimize reactivity graph and bundle delivery.
5.  **Verification**: Verify component behavior and reactive state flows.

## Best Practices

- Use `<script setup>` for concise component definition.
- Extract logic into reusable Composables.
- Use Pinia for centralized state management.
- Optimize for reactivity overhead.
