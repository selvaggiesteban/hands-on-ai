### 6.9. SEO and Web Analytics

(Google Analytics, Looker Studio, Google Search Console, Google My Business, PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog, Semrush, Ahrefs, etc.)

- Google Analytics (or GA4) tracking is correctly installed on all necessary pages.
- Key business goals/events are configured (conversions, leads, etc.).
- The site is verified in Google Search Console and has no unreviewed critical errors.
- The sitemap is submitted and accepted in Google Search Console.
- Google My Business (Google Business Profile) is claimed and correctly filled out (NAP, categories, hours).
- No serious performance errors are detected in PageSpeed Insights (unjustifiably high LCP, CLS, INP).
- Analyses with Screaming Frog or other tools do not show serious indexing problems (4xx, 5xx, poorly defined canonicals, etc.).
- SEO tools (Semrush, Ahrefs, etc.) do not indicate penalties or unaddressed critical issues.
