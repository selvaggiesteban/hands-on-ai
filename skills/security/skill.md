# Security Engineering Skill

This skill provides expert capabilities in infrastructure and application security, focusing on vulnerability management, compliance, and secure architecture.

## Capabilities

- **DevSecOps**: CI/CD security scanning (SAST/DAST), Container security
- **Cloud Security**: IAM, VPC design, WAF, Encryption (KMS/Vault)
- **Compliance**: Automation, Auditing, Policy enforcement (CIS/SOC2)
- **Incident Response**: Detection, Analysis, Containment, Recovery

## Process

1.  **Security Assessment**: Perform vulnerability scans and threat modeling.
2.  **Architecture Review**: Analyze infrastructure and access patterns for risks.
3.  **Implementation**: Deploy security controls (WAF, IAM policies, Encryption).
4.  **Automation**: Integrate security checks into build and deployment pipelines.
5.  **Verification**: Conduct penetration testing and compliance audits.

## Best Practices

- Adopt a "Shift-Left" security approach.
- Enforce Least Privilege access universally.
- Automate secret management (never hardcode secrets).
- Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities and threats.
